# AB Test Results data analysis.

## Intro
This is a **student project** from the **Udacity Nanodegree "Data Analyst"**.
The goal of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website because A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

## Dataset relevant info
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

##### Documents I received to explore the dataset:
- Dataset: `ab_data.csv`dataset.
- `countries.csv` dataset.

#### Feature of interest:
We would like to know if the company should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

#### Finding I got from my exploratory data analysis:
- There is not enough evidence to suggest that the new page will have more
conversions than the old page. The analysis suggests that the new page won't bring much value so we should stay with the old page.

## My analysis:
- `Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook_sara.ipynb` (ant its html version) data analysis.
